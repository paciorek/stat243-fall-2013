This will cover some of the more advanced features of R that were not covered,

I'm going to try to refer to R syntax as statements, where a statement is
 any code that is a valid, complete R expression.
 I'll try not to use the term

One of my goals in our coverage of R is for us to think about why things

 This will generally back out gracefully, returning you to a state as if

Packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the killer apps of R is the extensive collection of add-on packages
 on 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CRAN (www.cran.r-project.org)"
target "www.cran.r-project.org"

\end_inset

 that provide much of R's functionality.
 To make use of a package it needs to be installed on your system (using
 
\emph on
install.packages()
\emph default
 once only) and loaded into R (using 
\emph on
library()
\emph default
 every time you start R).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some packages are 
\emph on
installed
\emph default
 by default with R and of these, some are 
\emph on
loaded
\emph default
 by default, while others require a call to 
\emph on
library()
\emph default
.
 For packages I use a lot, I install them once and then load them automatically
 every time I start R using my 
\emph on
~/.Rprofile
\emph default
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Loading packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use 
\emph on
library()
\emph default
 to either (1) make a package available (loading it) or (2) to see all the
 installed packages.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that some of the packages are in a system directory and some are
 in my home directory.
 Packages often depend on other packages.
 In general, if one package depends on another, R will load the dependency,
 but if the dependency is installed locally (see below), R may not find
 it automatically and you may have to use 
\emph on
library()
\emph default
 to load the dependency first.
 
\emph on
.libPaths()
\emph default
 shows where R looks for packages on your system and searchpaths() shows
 where individual packages are loaded from.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Installing packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a package is on CRAN but not on your system, you can install it easily
 (usually).
 You don't need root permission on a machine to install a package (though
 sometimes you run into hassles if you are installing it just as a user,
 so if you have administrative privileges it may help to use them).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also download the zipped source file from CRAN and install from
 the file; see the help page for 
\emph on
install.packages()
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Accessing objects from packages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objects in a package (primarily functions, but also data) are in their
 own workspaces, and are accessible after you load the package using 
\emph on
library()
\emph default
, but are not directly visible when you use 
\emph on
ls()
\emph default
.
 We'll talk more about this when we talk about scope and environments.
 If we want to see the objects in one of the other workspaces, we can do
 the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk7>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

search()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

# ls(pos = 8) # for the stats package
\end_layout

Assignment and coercion

\begin_layout Standard
We assign into an object using either '
\emph on

\emph default
' or '
\emph on
<-
\emph default
'.
 A rule of thumb is that for basic assignments where you have an object
 name, then the assignment operator, and then some code, '
\emph on
=
\emph default
' is fine, but otherwise use '
\emph on
<-
\emph default
'.

What can you tell me about what is going on in each case above?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One situation in which you want to use '
\emph on
<-
\emph default
' is if it is being used as part of an argument to a function, so that R
 realizes you're not indicating one of the function arguments, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk9a>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

mat <- matrix(c(1, NA, 2, 3), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\begin_layout Chunk

# What is the side effect of what I have done here?

\begin_layout Chunk

apply(mat, 1, sum.isna = function(vec) {return(sum(is.na(vec)))}) # NOPE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

R often treats integers as numerics, but we can force R to store values
 as integers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk10>>=

\begin_layout Chunk

vals <- c(1, 2, 3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

class(vals)

\begin_layout Chunk

vals <- 1:3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\begin_layout Chunk

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

vals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

class(vals)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We convert between classes using variants on 
\emph on
as()
\emph default
: e.g., 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk11>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

as.character(c(1,2,3))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

as.numeric(c("1", "2.73"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

as.factor(c("a", "b", "c"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some common conversions are converting numbers that are being interpreted
 as characters into actual numbers, converting between factors and characters,
 and converting between logical TRUE/FALSE vectors and numeric 1/0 vectors.
 In some cases R will automatically do conversions behind the scenes in
 a smart way (or occasionally not so smart way).
 We saw see implicit conversion (also called coercion) when we read in character
s into R using 
\emph on
read.table()
\emph default
 - strings are often automatically coerced to factors.
 Consider these examples of implicit coercion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk13>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

x <- rnorm(5)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

x[3] <- 'hat' # What do you think is going to happen?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

indices = c(1, 2.73)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

myVec = 1:10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

myVec[indices]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other languages, converting between different classes is sometimes called
 
\emph on
casting
\emph default
 a variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example we can work through that will help illustrate how type
 conversions occur behind the scenes in R.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\begin_layout Chunk

# why does that not work?

\begin_layout Subsection
Type vs.
 class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should be familiar with vectors as the basic data structure in R, with
 character, integer, numeric, etc.
 classes.
 Objects also have a type, which relates to what kind of values are in the
 objects and how objects are stored internally in R (i.e., in C).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at Adler's Table 7.1 to see some other types.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk12>>=

\begin_layout Chunk

a <- data.frame(x = 1:2)

\begin_layout Chunk

typeof(m)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everything in R is an object and all objects have a class.
 For simple objects class and type are often closely related, but this is
 not the case for more complicated objects.
 The class describes what the object contains and standard functions associated
 with it.
 In general, you mainly need to know what class an object is rather than
 its type.
 Classes can 
\emph on
inherit
\emph default
 from other classes; for example, the 
\emph on
glm
\emph default
 class inherits characteristics from the 
\emph on
lm
\emph default
 class.
 We'll see more on the details of object-oriented programming in the R programmi
ng unit.

\begin_layout Standard
We can create objects with our own defined class.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Attributes
\emph default
 are information about an object attached to an object as something that
 looks like a named list.
 Attributes are often copied when operating on an object.
 This can lead to some weird-looking formatting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk16>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

x <- rnorm(10 * 365)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

qs <- quantile(x, c(.025, .975))

\begin_layout Chunk

qs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

qs[1] + 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus in an subsequent operations with 
\emph on
qs
\emph default
, the 
\emph on
names
\emph default
 attribute will often get carried along.
 We can get rid of it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\begin_layout Chunk

names(qs) <- NULL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

qs

Note that to operate on a data frame, which is a list, we'll generally want
 to use 
\emph on

 a column for differentiating the repeated measurements.

 groups, such as ANOVA or mixed models.

Functions, variable scoping, and frames
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Functions are at the heart of R.
 In general, you should try to have functions be self-contained - operating
 only on arguments provided to them, and producing no side effects, though
 in some cases there are good reasons for making an exception.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Functions that are not implemented internally in R (i.e., user-defined functions)
 are also referred to offically as 
\emph on
closures
\emph default
 (this is their 
\emph on
type
\emph default
) - this terminology sometimes comes up in error messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguments can be specifed in the correct order, or given out of order by
 specifying 
\emph on
name = value
\emph default
.
 In general the more important arguments are specified first.
 You can see the arguments and defaults for a function using 
\emph on
args()
\emph default
:

\begin_layout Standard
Functions may have unspecified arguments, which is designated using '...'.
 Unspecified arguments occurring at the beginning of the argument list are
 generally a collection of like objects that will be manipulated (consider
 
\emph on
paste()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
c()
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
rbind()
\emph default
), while unspecified arguments occurring at the end are often optional arguments
 (consider 
\emph on
plot()
\emph default
).
 These optional arguments are sometimes passed along to a function within
 the function.
 For example, here's my own wrapper for plotting, where any additional arguments
 specified by the user will get passed along to plot:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk44>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

pplot <- function(x, y, pch = 16, cex = 0.4, ...) {

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to manipulate what the user passed in as the 
\emph on

\emph default
 args, rather than just passing them along, you can extract them (the following
 code would be used within a function to which

\begin_layout Standard
You can check if an argument is missing with 
\emph on
missing()
\emph default
.
 Arguments can also have default values, which may be 
\emph on
NULL
\emph default
.
 If you are writing a function and designate the default as 
\emph on
argname = NULL
\emph default
, you can check whether the user provided anything using
\family typewriter
 is.null(argname).

\family default
 The default values can also relate to other arguments.
 As an example, consider 
\emph on
dgamma()
\emph default

Functions can be passed in as arguments (e.g., see the variants of

\emph default

\begin_layout Paragraph
Pass by value vs.
 pass by reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that R makes a copy of all objects that are arguments to a function,
 with the copy residing in the frame (the environment) of the function (we'll
 see more about frames just below).
 This is a case of 
\emph on
pass by value
\emph default
.
 In other languages it is also possible to 
\emph on
pass by reference
\emph default
, in which case, changes to the object made within the function affect the
 value of the argument in the calling environment.
 R's designers chose not to allow pass by reference because they didn't
 like the idea that a function could have the side effect of changing an
 object.
 However, passing by reference can sometimes be very helpful, and we'll
 see ways of passing by reference in the R programming unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important exception is 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
.
 If you change graphics parameters by calling 
\emph on
par()
\emph default
 in a user-defined function, they are changed permanently.
 One trick is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk50, eval=FALSE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

f <- function(){
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

	oldpar <- par()

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

}
\end_layout

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that changing graphics parameters within a specific plotting function
 - e.g.,

plot(x, y, pch = '+')
\family default
, doesn't change things except for that particular plot.
\end_layout

\emph default
 is not specified, the output is the result of the last evaluated statement.

 can occur anywhere in the function, and allows the function to exit as

\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environments and frames are closely related.
 An environment is a collection of named objects (a frame), with a pointer
 to the 'enclosing environment', i.e., the next environment to look for something
 in, also called the parent.
 (Be careful as this is different than the parent frame of a function.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variables in the enclosing environment (the environment in which a function
 is defined, also called the parent environment) are available within a
 function.
 This is the analog of 
\emph on
global variables
\emph default
 in other languages.
 Note that enclosing/parent environment is NOT the environment from which
 the function was called.
 This is called 
\emph on
lexical scoping
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be careful when using variables from the enclosing environment as the value
 of that variable in the enclosing environment may well not be what you
 expect it to be.
 In general it's bad practice to use variables that are taken from environments
 outside that of a function, but it some cases it can be useful.

\begin_layout Subsection
Environments and the search path
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we've seen lexical scoping in action primarily in terms of finding
 variables in a single enclosing environment.
 But what if the variable is not found in either the frame/environment of
 the function or the enclosing environment? When R goes looking for an object
 (in the form of a symbol), it starts in the current environment (e.g., the
 frame/environment of a function) and then runs up through the enclosing
 environments, until it reaches the global environment, which is where R
 starts when you start it (it actually continues further up; see below).
 In general, as we've seen, these are not the frames on the stack.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default objects are created in the global environment, 
\emph on
.GlobalEnv
\emph default
.
 As we've seen, the environment within a function call has as its enclosing
 environment the environment where the function was defined (not the environment
 from which it was called), and this is next place that is searched if an
 object can't be found in the frame of the function call.
 This is called lexical scoping (and differs from the S language on which
 R was based).
 As an example, if an object couldn't be found within the environment of
 an 
\emph on
lm()
\emph default
 function call, R would first look in the environment (also called the namespace
) of the stats package (since this is the environment where 
\emph on
lm()
\emph default
 is defined), then in packages imported by the stats package, then the base
 package, and then the global environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If R can't find the object when reaching the global environment, it runs
 through the search path, which you can see with 
\emph on
search()
\emph default
.
 The search path is a set of additional environments.
 Generally packages are created with namespaces, i.e., each has its own environmen
t, as we see based on 
\emph on
search()
\emph default
.
 Data frames or list that you attach using 
\emph on
attach()
\emph default
 generally are placed just after the global environment.

We can also see the nestedness of environments using the following code,

 the empty environment.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can retrieve and assign objects in a particular environment as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk62>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

lm <- function() {return(NULL)} # this seems dangerous but isn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

\begin_layout Chunk

mod <- stats::lm(y ~ x) # an alternative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

@
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that our (bogus) 
\emph on
lm()
\emph default
 function masks but does not overwrite the default function.
 If we remove ours, then the default one is still there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Frames and the call stack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R keeps track of the call stack, which is the set of nested calls to functions.
 The stack operates like a stack of cafeteria trays - when a function is
 called, it is added to the stack (pushed) and when it finishes, it is removed
 (popped).
 There are a bunch of functions that let us query what frames are on the
 stack and access objects in particular frames of interest.
 This gives us the ability to work with objects in the environment(s) from
 which a function was called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
sys.nframe()
\emph default
 returns the number of the current frame and 
\emph on
sys.parent()
\emph default
 the number of the parent, while parent.frame() gives the name of the parent
 environment.
 Careful: here, 
\emph on
parent
\emph default
 now refers to the parent in terms of the call stack, not the enclosing
 environment.
 
\emph on
sys.frame()
\emph default
 gives the name of the environment for a given frame number (for non-negative
 numbers).
 For negative numbers, it goes back that many frames in the call stack and
 returns the name of the associated environment.
 I won't print the results here because 
\emph on
knitr
\emph default
 messes up the frame counting somehow.

What happens when an R function is evaluated? The user-provided function

 A new environment is created, and assignment to those names is done in
 the environment, including any default arguments.
 The body of the function is evaluated in the environment.

Loops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Loops are at the core of programming in other functional languages, but
 in R, we often try to avoid them as they're often (but not always) slow.
 In many cases looping can be avoided by using vectorized calculations,
 versions of 
\emph on
apply()
\emph default
, and other tricks.
 But sometimes they're unavoidable and for quick and dirty coding and small
 problems, they're fine.
 And in some cases they may be faster than other alternatives.
 One case we've already seen is that in working with lists they may be faster
 than their 
\emph on
lapply
\emph default
-style counterpart, though often they will not be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The workhorse loop is the 
\emph on
for

 loop, which as the syntax: 
\family typewriter
\series bold
for(var in sequence) statement
\family default

, where, as with the 
\emph on
if

 statement, we need curly braces around the body of the loop if it contains
 more than one valid R statement:

\begin_layout Itemize
Protecting arithmetic expressions:

\begin_layout Itemize
Using functions of variables
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline

Text manipulations and regular expressions

\begin_layout Standard
Text manipulations in R have a number of things in common with Perl, Python
 and UNIX, as many of these evolved from UNIX.
 When I use the term 
\emph on
string
\emph default
 here, I'll be refering to any sequence of characters that may include numbers,
 white space, and special characters, rather than to the character class
 of R objects.
 The string or strings will generally be stored as R character vectors.

\emph on
paste()
\emph default
, 
\emph on

\emph default
, and 
\emph on
substring()
\emph default
.
 
\emph on
paste()
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
strsplit()
\emph default
 are basically inverses of each other: 
\emph on
paste()
\emph default
 concatenates together an arbitrary set of strings (or a vector, if using
 the 
\emph on
collapse
\emph default
 argument) with a user-specified separator character, while 
\emph on
strsplit()
\emph default
 splits apart based on a delimiter/separator.

\series bold
 
\series default
\emph on
substring()
\emph default
 splits apart the elements of a character vector based on fixed widths.
 Note that all of these operate in a vectorized fashion.

 can be used to replace a specified string with a replacement string (use

Overview and core syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
grep()
\emph default
, 
\emph on
gregexpr()
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
gsub()
\emph default
 functions are more powerful when used with regular expressions.
 Regular expressions are a domain-specific language for finding patterns
 and are one of the key functionalities in scripting languages such as Perl
 and Python, as well as the UNIX utilities 
\emph on
sed
\emph default
, 
\emph on
awk
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
grep
\emph default
.
 Duncan Temple Lang (UC Davis Statistics) has written a nice tutorial that
 I've put in the repository (
\emph on
regexpr-Lang.pdf
\emph default
) or check out Sections 9.9 and 11 of Murrell.
 We'll just cover the use of regular expressions in R, but once you know
 that, it would be easy to use them elsewhere (Python, grep and other UNIX
 commands, etc.).
 What I describe here is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extended regular expression
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 syntax (POSIX 1003.2), but with the argument 
\family typewriter
Perl=TRUE
\family default
, you can get Perl-style regular expressions.
 At the level we'll consider them, the syntax is quite similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of regular expressions is that they allow us to find matches
 of strings or patterns in strings, as well as do substitution.
 Regular expressions are good for tasks such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
extracting pieces of text - for example finding all the links in an html
 document;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
creating variables from information found in text;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cleaning and transforming text into a uniform format;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
mining text by treating documents as data; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
scraping the web for data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regular expressions are constructed from three things: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Literal characters
\emph default
 are matched only by the characters themselves,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Character classes
\emph default
 are matched by any single member in the class, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Modifiers
\emph default
 operate on either of the above or combinations of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the syntax is very concise, so it's helpful to break down individual
 regular expressions into the component parts to understand them.
 As Murrell notes, since regexp are their own language, it's a good idea
 to build up a regexp in pieces as a way of avoiding errors just as we would
 with any computer code.
 
\emph on
gregexpr()
\emph default
 is particularly useful in seeing 
\series bold
what
\series default
 was matched to help in understanding and learning regular expression syntax
 and debugging your regexp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The special characters (meta-characters) used for defining regular expressions
 are: 
\emph on
* .
 ^ $ + ? ( ) [ ] { } | 
\backslash
 
\emph default
.
 To use these characters literally as characters, we have to 'escape' them.
 In R, we have to use two backslashes insstead of a single backslash because
 R uses a single backslash to symbolize certain control characters, such
 as 
\emph on

\backslash
n
\emph default
 for newline.
 Outside of R, one would only need a single backslash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Character sets and character classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we want to search for any one of a set of characters, we use a character
 set, such as 
\family typewriter
[13579]
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
[abcd]
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
[0-9]
\family default
 (where the dash indicates a sequence) or 
\family typewriter
[0-9a-z]
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
[ 
\backslash
t]
\family default
.
 To indicate any character not in a set, we place a ^ just inside the first
 bracket: 
\family typewriter
[^abcd]
\family default
.
 The period stands for any character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a bunch of named character classes so that we don't have write
 out common sets of characters.
 The syntax is 
\family typewriter
[:class:]
\family default
 where 
\emph on
class
\emph default
 is the name of the class.
 The classes include the 
\emph on
digit
\emph default
, 
\emph on
alpha
\emph default
, 
\emph on
alnum
\emph default
, 
\emph on
lower
\emph default
, 
\emph on
upper
\emph default
, 
\emph on
punct
\emph default
, 
\emph on
blank
\emph default
, 
\emph on
space 
\emph default
(see 
\family typewriter
?regexp
\family default
 in R for formal definitions of all of these, but most are fairly self-explanato
ry).
 To make a character set with a character class you need two square brackets,
 e.g.
 the digit class: 
\family typewriter
[[:digit:]]
\family default
.
 Or we can make a combined character set such as 
\family typewriter
[[:alnum]_]
\family default
.
 E.g., the latter would be useful in looking for email addresses.
 If you use the 
\family typewriter
[:class:]
\family default
 syntax, you need to use the 
\family typewriter
perl=TRUE
\family default
 argument to the relevant function to make use of Perl-style regular expressions.

Repetitions

\begin_layout Standard
Now suppose I wanted to be able to detect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

V1@gra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as well.
 I need to be able to deal with repetitions of character sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can indicate repetitions as indicated in these examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[[:digit:]]* -- any number of digits (zero or more)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[[:digit:]]+ -- at least one digit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[[:digit:]]? -- zero or one digits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[[:digit:]]{1,3} -- at least one and no more than three digits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[[:digit:]]{2,} -- two or more digits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example is that 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash
[.*
\backslash

\backslash
]
\family default
 is the pattern of any number of characters (
\emph on
.*
\emph default
) separated by square brackets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Paragraph
Grouping and references
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often want to be able to look for multi-character patterns and to be
 able to refer back to the patterns that are found.
 Both are accomplished with parentheses.
 We can search for a group of characters as follows by putting the group
 in parentheses, such as 
\family typewriter
([[:digit:]]{1,3}
\backslash

\backslash
.)
\family default
 to find a 1 to 3 digit number followed by a period.
 Here's an example of searching for an IP number:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

<<chunk90a, eval=FALSE>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chunk

grep("([[:digit:]]{1,3}
\backslash
